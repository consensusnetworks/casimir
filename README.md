Decentralized staking and asset management

## About

Casimir is an all-in-one platform that allows users to trade, stake and track their assets while holding their own keys. One of Casimir's primary objectives is to reward crypto users for directly participating-in and strengthening the networks they rely on â€“ by helping them stake directly to the most reliable (big and small) validators on PoS networks.

## Status

Casimir is an early work-in-progress â€“ check out [our website](https://casimir.co) for more information about what we're building. See ongoing tasks on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/consensusnetworks/projects/9/views/1).

Also, feel free to join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Vy2b3gSZx8) if you want to say hello and discuss the project.

## ðŸ’» Development

Get started contributing to Casimir's codebase.

### Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment has these prerequisites.

1. [Node.js (v16.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) â€“ we use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

2. [Docker (v4.x)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - make sure your Docker runs on startup.

3. [AWS CLI (v2.x)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) â€“ create an [AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) named `consensus-networks-dev`.

4. [SAM CLI (v1.x)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html) - tool for mocking backend services locally.

> ðŸš© You also need to make sure to have at least one SSH authentication key on your GitHub account (for the git cloning of submodules in various scripts). See [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### Scripts and Dependencies

We are using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to simplify monorepo development workflows while keeping project-wide resources accessible.

### Setup

Clone the repository, checkout a new branch from develop, and install all workspace dependencies.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/consensusnetworks/casimir.git
cd casimir
git checkout -b feature/stake-button develop
npm install
```

> ðŸš© 'All workspace dependencies' includes `package.json` dependencies listed in the project root and any workspace subdirectories. See [Scripts and dependencies](#-scripts-and-dependencies).

### Apps

You can get up and running without configuration. You can also mock local backend changes and customize your environment.

1. For frontend changes â€“ run the development server and use the `dev` stage backend services.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev
    ```

    > ðŸš© This will also preconfigure the application environment with the AWS credentials for the `consensus-networks-dev` profile (set PROFILE="some-other-name" in a [.env](.env) if you want to override).

2. For fullstack changes â€“ run the development server and mock the local backend services.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev --mock
    ```

    > ðŸš© You will need the [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html) for local mocking.

3. Emulate a Ledger hardware wallet with [Speculos](#speculos). The default application is ethereum, and we also currently have support for the bitcoin and solana applications.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev --speculos # or specify --speculos=ethereum, --speculos=bitcoin, or --speculos=solana
    ```

    > ðŸš© On MacOS, if you get an error because port 5000 is in use, go to ï£¿ > System Preferences... > Sharing and uncheck Airplay Receiver.
    
4. The commands and flags above apply to any package in the [apps](apps/) directory. While the default app is [@casimir/web](apps/web/), you can specify others by passing a subcommand to `npm run dev`.

    ```zsh
    # @casimir/web
    npm run dev # or
    npm run dev:web

    # @casimir/landing
    npm run dev:landing
    ```

### Hardhat

Ethereum contract development is serviced through [Hardhat](https://hardhat.io/). The Hardhat development environment is configured in the [contracts/ethereum/hardhat.config.ts](contracts/ethereum/hardhat.config.ts) file.

1. Compile the contracts in [contracts/ethereum](contracts/ethereum).
    
    ```zsh
    npm run task:compile --workspace @casimir/ethereum
    ```

2. Deploy a contract, specifically [contracts/ethereum/src/SSVManager.sol](contracts/ethereum/src/Sample.sol) with [contracts/ethereum/deploy/ssv.deploy.ts](contracts/ethereum/deploy/ssv.deploy.ts).

    ```zsh
    npm run deploy:ssv --workspace @casimir/ethereum
    ```

3. Test the Sample with the tests in [contracts/ethereum/test/sample.ts](contracts/ethereum/test/sample.ts).

    ```zsh
    npm run test --workspace @casimir/ethereum
    ```

4. Use a contract in the Casimir web app.

    ```typescript
    // Todo add Casimir Typescript usage
    ```

5. Clean [contracts/ethereum/build/artifacts](contracts/ethereum/build/artifacts) and [contracts/ethereum/build/cache](contracts/ethereum/build/cache)).    

    ```zsh
    npm run task:clean --workspace @casimir/ethereum
    ```

    > ðŸš© Note, this is required if you change the Hardhat configuration.

### Local Nodes

Run local cryptonodes for fast and flexible development.

1. Run a local Ethereum node without archived data.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev:ethereum
    ```

2. Run a local Ethereum node with archived data from mainnet.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev:ethereum --fork mainnet
    ```

3. Run a local Ethereum node with archived data from Goerli testnet.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev:ethereum --fork testnet
    ```

> ðŸš© Note, while the fork starts with the same state as the specified network, it lives as a local development network.

### Environment

Optionally customize and override the defaults for your *local development environment* by creating a [.env](.env) file in the project root and adding values for any supported variables.

```zsh
PROFILE="some-other-aws-name"
STAGE="sandbox"
```

#### Supported Variables

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROFILE` | AWS profile name | `"consensus-networks-dev"` |
| `STAGE` | Environment stage name | `"dev"` |

### Scripts and dependencies

We are using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to simplify monorepo development workflows while keeping project-wide resources accessible. The core commands are below.

Install all monorepo dependencies.

```zsh
npm install
```

Clean all monorepo dependencies (remove all `node_modules` before a fresh install).

```zsh
npm run clean
```

Install a project-wide dev dependency.

```zsh
npm install -D some-dev-dependency
```

Install a workspace dependency or dev dependency.

```zsh
npm install some-dependency --workspace @casimir/workspace-name # i.e. @casimir/web
# or
npm install -D some-dev-dependency --workspace @casimir/workspace-name
```

## ðŸ“Š Data

Data schemas, data operations/workflows, and analytics and ML notebooks are stored in the [common/data/] directory (also namespaced as the @casimir/data npm workspace). See the [Data Contribution Guide](common/data/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Layout

Code is organized into work directories (apps, services, infrastructure â€“ and more listed below).

```tree
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/ (workflows and issue templates)
|   â””â”€â”€ workflows/ (gh actions workflows)
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/ (frontend apps)
    |â”€â”€ landing/ (landing page app)
|   â””â”€â”€ web/ (main web app)
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/ (deployment resources)
|   â””â”€â”€ cdk/ (aws stacks)
â”œâ”€â”€ common/ (shared code)
|   â””â”€â”€ helpers/ (general utilities)
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/ (devops and build scripts)
|   â””â”€â”€ local/ (mock and serve tasks)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/ (backend services)
|   â””â”€â”€ auth/ (auth lambda api)
â””â”€â”€ package.json (project-wide npm dependencies and scripts)
```

> ðŸš© While developing, most likely, you shouldn't have to change into any subdirectories to run commands. Individual **npm packages** (directories with a `package.json`) are managed from the project root with [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces). See [Scripts and dependencies](#-scripts-and-dependencies).

## Editor

Feel free to use any editor, but here's a configuration that works with this codebase.

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€“ you could also use another editor, but this helps us guarantee linter/formatter features.

2. [Volar VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) â€“ Vue 3 language support (turn off vetur and ts/js language features if you have problems arising from conflicts).

3. [Eslint VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) â€“ linter and formatter.
