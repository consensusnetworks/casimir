Decentralized staking and asset management

## About

Casimir is an all-in-one platform that allows users to trade, stake and track their assets while holding their own keys. One of Casimir's primary objectives is to reward crypto users for directly participating-in and strengthening the networks they rely on – by helping them stake directly to the most reliable (big and small) validators on PoS networks.

## Status

Casimir is an early work-in-progress – check out [our website](https://casimir.co) for more information about what we're building. See ongoing tasks on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/consensusnetworks/projects/9/views/1).

Also, feel free to join our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Vy2b3gSZx8) if you want to say hello and discuss the project.

## 💻 Development

Get started contributing to Casimir's codebase.

### Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment has these prerequisites.

1. [Node.js (v16.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) – we use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

2. [AWS CLI (v2.x)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) – create an [AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) named `consensus-networks-dev`.

3. [SAM CLI (v1.x)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html) - tool for mocking backend services locally.

### Scripts and Dependencies

We are using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to simplify monorepo development workflows while keeping project-wide resources accessible.

### Setup

Clone the repository, checkout a new branch from develop, and install all workspace dependencies.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/consensusnetworks/casimir.git
cd casimir
git checkout -b feature/stake-button develop
npm install
```

> 🚩 'All workspace dependencies' includes `package.json` dependencies listed in the project root and any workspace subdirectories. See [Scripts and dependencies](#-scripts-and-dependencies).

### Apps

You can get up and running without configuration. You can also mock local backend changes and customize your environment.

1. For frontend changes – run the development server and use the `dev` stage backend services.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev
    ```

    > 🚩 This will also preconfigure the application environment with the AWS credentials for the `consensus-networks-dev` profile (set PROFILE="some-other-name" in a [.env](.env) if you want to override).

2. For fullstack changes – run the development server and mock the local backend services.

    ```zsh
    npm run dev --mock
    ```

    > 🚩 You will need the [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-mac.html) for local mocking.

### Hardhat

Solidity contract development is serviced through [Hardhat](https://hardhat.io/). The Hardhat development environment is configured in the [contracts/solidity/hardhat.config.ts](contracts/solidity/hardhat.config.ts) file.

1. Compile the contracts in [contracts/solidity](contracts/solidity).
    
    ```zsh
    npm run task:compile
    ```

2. Deploy a contract, specifically [contracts/solidity/src/Sample.sol](contracts/solidity/src/Sample.sol) with [contracts/solidity/deploy/sample.ts](contracts/solidity/deploy/sample.ts).

    ```zsh
    npm run deploy:sample
    ```

3. Test the Sample with the tests in [contracts/solidity/test/sample.ts](contracts/solidity/test/sample.ts).

    ```zsh
    npm run test:contracts
    ```

4. Start a local Ethereum node.

    ```zsh
    npm run node:local
    ```

5. Print all local accounts.

    ```zsh
    npm run task:accounts
    ```

*Todo finish sample flow (show usage of compiled contract ABI in app)*
6. Use a contract in a Casimir app...
   
7. Clean [contracts/solidity/build/artifacts](contracts/solidity/build/artifacts) and [contracts/solidity/build/cache](contracts/solidity/build/cache)).    

    ```zsh
    npm run task:clean
    ``` 

    > 🚩 Note, this is required if you change the Hardhat configuration.

### Environment

Optionally customize and override the defaults for your *local development environment* by creating a [.env](.env) file in the project root and adding values for any supported variables.

```zsh
PROFILE="some-other-aws-name"
STAGE="sandbox"
```

#### Supported Variables

| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROFILE` | AWS profile name | `"consensus-networks-dev"` |
| `STAGE` | Environment stage name | `"dev"` |

### Scripts and dependencies

We are using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to simplify monorepo development workflows while keeping project-wide resources accessible. The core commands are below.

Install all monorepo dependencies.

```zsh
npm install
```

Clean all monorepo dependencies (remove all `node_modules` before a fresh install).

```zsh
npm run clean
```

Install a project-wide dev dependency.

```zsh
npm install -D some-dev-dependency
```

Install a workspace dependency or dev dependency.

```zsh
npm install some-dependency --workspace @casimir/workspace-name # i.e. @casimir/website
# or
npm install -D some-dev-dependency --workspace @casimir/workspace-name
```

## 📝 Content

Get started contributing to Casimir's content.

### Writing

Writing content is stored in the [content/writing](content/writing/) directory. See the [Writing Contribution Guide](content/writing/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

### Emails

AWS Pinpont email templates and shared components are stored in the [content/email](content/email/) directory. See the [Email Contribution Guide](content/email/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## 📊 Data

Data schemas, data operations/workflows, and analytics and ML notebooks are stored in the [common/data/] directory (also namespaced as the @casimir/data npm workspace). See the [Data Contribution Guide](common/data/README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Layout

Code is organized into work directories (apps, services, infrastructure – and more listed below).

```tree
├── .github/ (workflows and issue templates)
|   └── workflows/ (gh actions workflows)
├── apps/ (frontend apps)
|   └── website/ (main web app)
├── infrastructure/ (deployment resources)
|   └── cdk/ (aws stacks)
├── common/ (shared code)
|   └── lib/ (general utilities)
├── content/ (static code and text)
|   └── email/ (pinpoint templates)
├── scripts/ (devops and build scripts)
|   └── local/ (mock and serve tasks)
├── services/ (backend services)
|   └── users/ (users lambda api)
└── package.json (project-wide npm dependencies and scripts)
```

> 🚩 While developing, most likely, you shouldn't have to change into any subdirectories to run commands. Individual **npm packages** (directories with a `package.json`) are managed from the project root with [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces). See [Scripts and dependencies](#-scripts-and-dependencies).

## Editor

Feel free to use any editor, but here's a configuration that works with this codebase.

1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – you could also use another editor, but this helps us guarantee linter/formatter features.

2. [Volar VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) – Vue 3 language support (turn off vetur and ts/js language features if you have problems arising from conflicts).

3. [Eslint VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) – linter and formatter.
