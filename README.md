## About

Casimir is a complete platform that allows users to monitor, move, and stake their assets while holding their own keys. With Casimir staking, users can easily and securely move funds in and out of decentralized staking pools that are operated by high-performing validators.

## Development

Get started contributing to Casimir's codebase.

### Prerequisites

Configure the following prerequisite global dependency versions.

1. [Docker (v24.x)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

2. [Git (v2.x)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

    > ðŸš© GitHub submodule support: You also need to make sure to have at least one SSH authentication key on your GitHub account (for the git cloning of submodules in various scripts). See [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

3. [Go (v1.18.x)](https://golang.org/doc/install).

4. [Node.js (v18.x)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

5. [Optional: AWS CLI (v2.x)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

    > ðŸš© **Consensus Networks team only**: Create an [AWS profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) named `consensus-networks-dev`.

### Setup

Clone the repository and checkout a new branch from develop.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/consensusnetworks/casimir.git
cd casimir
git checkout -b <"feature || bug || enhancement">/<"your-branch-name" develop
```

We are using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to simplify monorepo development workflows while keeping project-wide resources accessible. The core commands are below.

Install all repository dependencies and build necessary types.

```zsh
npm install
```

  > ðŸš© To see output from a npm preinstall or postinstall script on `npm i`, run `npm i --foreground-scripts`.

Clean all repository dependencies and reinstall.

```zsh
npm run clean
```

Install a dev dependency to the root.

```zsh
npm install -D some-dev-dependency
```

Install a dependency or dev dependency to a specific workspace.

```zsh
# dependency
npm install some-dependency --workspace @casimir/<"workspace-name">

# dev dependency
npm install -D some-dev-dependency --workspace @casimir/<"workspace-name">
```

### Configure

Customize and override the development environment configuration by creating a [.env](.env) file in the root directory.

**If you are on the Consensus Networks organization**, make sure your AWS CLI and profile are configured correctly. By default, the scripts look for the `consensus-networks-dev` named profile, but you can override the `AWS_PROFILE` name to be used in the [.env](.env) file. Regardless, the profile must have access to the `consensus-networks-dev` account resources.

```zsh
# From the root directory
echo "AWS_PROFILE=<"your-aws-profile-name">" > .env
```

**If you are outside of the Consensus Networks organization**, make sure to set `USE_SECRETS` to `false`.

```zsh
# From the root directory
echo "USE_SECRETS=false" > .env
```

#### Environment Variables

| Name | Description | Default |
| - | - | - |
| `USE_SECRETS` | Whether to use AWS secrets (set false for external access) | `true` |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | AWS profile name for accessing secrets | `consensus-networks-dev` |
| `PROJECT` | Project name | `casimir` |
| `STAGE` | Environment stage name (`prod || dev || local`) | `local` |
| `ETHEREUM_FORK_BLOCK` | Starting block number for local fork network | (current block) |
| `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` | Ethereum RPC network URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8545` |
| `NETWORK` | Network name (`mainnet || testnet || hardhat || localhost`) | `localhost` |
| `FORK` | Fork network name (`mainnet || testnet || hardhat`) | `testnet` |
| `MANAGER_ADDRESS` | Manager contract address | (predicted manager address) |
| `VIEWS_ADDRESS` | Views contract address | (predicted views address) |
| `CRYPTO_COMPARE_API_KEY` | CryptoCompare API key | `` |
| `TUNNEL` | Whether to tunnel local network RPC URLs (for remote wallets) | `false` |
| `EMULATE` | Whether to emulate wallets | `false` |
| `LEDGER_APP` | Ledger app name | `ethereum` |
| `MOCK_SERVICES` | Whether to mock backend services | `true` |
| `BUILD_PREVIEW` | Whether to preview web app production build | `false` |

  > ðŸš© While running the Ledger Speculos emulator on MacOS (with EMULATORS=true), if you get a surprising error that port 5000 is in use, go to ï£¿ > System Preferences... > Sharing and uncheck Airplay Receiver.

### Apps

The apps packages provide a UI to end-users.

#### @casimir/web

Run the web app with an integrated development environment, including local contracts and services.

```zsh
# From the root directory
npm run dev
```

See the [@casimir/web README.md](apps/web/README.md) for detailed documentation.

#### @casimir/landing
