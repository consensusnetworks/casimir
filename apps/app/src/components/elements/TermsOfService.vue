      A. Eligibility
    </h6>
    <p class="body_text">
      I. This User Staking Agreement applies to all users of the Consensus Networks, Inc.
      (Consensus) staking platform (Users).
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      II. All are prohibited from accessing, using, or otherwise receiving any benefits of Consensus
      products or services who fail to satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in this User Staking
      Agreement or upon any breach or violation of any of the term or condition set forth herein.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      III. Users must be 21 years of age or older to use Consensus staking technology.
    </p>

    <h6 class="subtitle my-[5px]">
      B. Purpose
    </h6>
    <p class="body_text">
      IV. A main purpose for the Consensus staking platform is offering a decentralized and noncustodial
      mechanism for staking certain digital assets, which may include assets on blockchains
      such as Ethereum and Solana, among others. The main staking platform is a permissionless and
      decentralized mechanism for contributing to the Ethereum Consensus process.
    </p>

    <h6 class="subtitle my-[5px]">
      C. Risks
    </h6>
    <p class="body_text">
      V. All Users use staking services at their own risk and agree to bear the full risk of loss for all
      their assets. Consensus will use reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all digital assets used
      on the staking platform.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      VI. All software and associated services are offered on an as is basis for the benefit of Users.
      Users acknowledge that there is inherent risk in decentralized applications and that Users may
      lose all or some of their assets in the process of using the Consensus staking platform.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      VII. Users agree that digital assets are extremely volatile and that in certain instances may be so
      volatile as to lose all value previously associated with the asset. Users agree to bear all risk for
      the volatility of assets, which they use to stake using Consensus smart contract staking
      technology.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      VIII. Consensus makes no guarantees that upgrades to the Ethereum, Solana, or any other
      blockchain network will be successful. Users agree and understand that if the network upgrade
      ultimately fails, Users may lose all, or a portion of, staked assets. Users agree Consensus is not
      responsible for any assets lost due to a network upgrade failure.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      IX. Users rewards may be dependent on the Ethereum network and appropriately received by
      Consensus or by any smart contract service Consensus offers. Users do not have an inherent right
      to reward for staking, however Consensus will use reasonable efforts to ensure sure the fair
      distribution of assets awarded via staking to Users.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      X. Consensus makes no warranties of any kind relating to staking services or products offered.
      Users understand and acknowledge there are inherent risks in using smart contract technology
      for staking and agree to bear the full risk of loss in the event of a hack or technical malfunction.
      Consensus will operate in good faith to ensure its smart contract technology functions securely
      and as intended.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XI. The process for withdrawing staked assets may change depending on the User. User assets
      may be locked in a smart contract for a specific time. Users agree to and acknowledge having
      certain asset locked, as part of using the staking technology.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XII. Users agree that blockchain network upgrades and forks may cause changes in staking
      protocols. Consensus will use good faith and reasonable efforts to ensure User assets are safe in
      the event of any significant fork or upgrade effecting User staking smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XIII. Staking ETH means your staked assets can be subject to slashing by the Ethereum network
      if the transaction validator representing those assets incorrectly validates a transaction.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XIV. Users agree that any smart contract they interact with is their responsibility. The staking
      platform is designed such that it should survive the company, Consensus Networks. The platform
      is inherently non-custodial, and Users agree to accept all responsibility for their assets which
      they use on the platform or associated smart contracts in the staking protocol.
    </p>
    <h6 class="subtitle my-[5px]">
      D. Compliance
    </h6>
    <p class="body_text">
      XV. Nothing within the Consensus staking services offerings is a promise of profit nor should be
      construed to confer a financial guarantee or any pecuniary interest in any asset or technology.
      Nothing within the technical mechanisms or services offerings associated with Consensus
      staking technology are security interests pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, nor should any
      technical mechanisms or services offerings be construed to convey any security interests.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XVI. The staking platform works hard to ensure compliance with United States law. In fact,
      compliance is a core feature for the development of the platform to enable decentralized, ethical,
      and legal staking solutions.
    </p>
    <h6 class="subtitle my-[5px]">
      E. Legal
    </h6>
    <p class="body_text">
      XVII. Consensus and all Users agree to abide by the law of relevant jurisdictions and to make
      reasonable efforts to do so. Users acknowledge the laws regarding digital assets and staking vary
      greatly between different countries and users are responsible for knowing the laws of their own
      countries.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XVIII. If a User is suspected of criminal activity, Consensus may take action to freeze or recover
      certain assets at its sole election.

    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XIX. Users are responsible for paying any taxes required to be paid on any assets earned through
      staking. Consensus bears no liability to pay taxes on assets decentralized to Users via the staking
      process.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XX. Users in certain jurisdictions, such as Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Ukraine, Central African
      Republic, North Korea, Libya, Liberia, Lebanon, Iraq, Congo, Zimbabwe, Yemen, Somalia,
      Balkans, Belarus, and Venezuela, may not use Consensus technology for any reason and are
      strictly prohibited from doing so. Users are otherwise responsible for abiding by the laws of the
      countries in which they reside while using Consensus staking technology. Consensus will use
      reasonable efforts to prevent Users residing within these jurisdictions from accessing staking
      technologies operated by Consensus.
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
      XXI. Consensus will use good faith in resolving User disputes. In the event of a User dispute
      with Consensus, the User agrees to resolve the dispute via arbitration.
