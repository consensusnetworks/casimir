# Casimir is Live on Goerli!

We're proud to announce that our distributed, self custody ETH staking platform, Casimir, is live on the ETH Goerli Testnet. Casimir is powered by distributed key generation and distributed validator technology. The Casimir SelfStake manager offers an approach where stakers can directly deposit any amount of ETH to high-performing Ethereum operators. This approach minimizes counterparty risk for users and enhances the decentralization of Ethereum staking:
* Validators duties are performed by openly registered (and collateralized) operators running distributed validator technology (DVT)
* Keys are trustlessly managed using zero-coordination distributed key generation (DKG)
* Automated actions (like compounding stake or handling a slash) are carried out by a decentralized oracle network (DON)
* The staking user experience is improved by wrapping staking contract actions using account abstraction.

By creating a smart contract primitive that trustlessly connects stakers and node operators, we create a customizable staking process that allows users to access new staking features, such as restaking. Over the next few weeks we'll be introducing some of these additional features to our platform.
