          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir combines users' ETH into 32 ETH pools and forms validator
            groups with 4 operators using Distributed Validator Technology,

            account?</span

          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir uses distributed validator tech to pool users' ETH into 32
            ETH pools across four node operators. Users maintain custody through
            DKG, and rewards are distributed in native ETH based on their pool

          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir enables users to stake any amount of ETH while keeping
            custody and earning rewards in native ETH. It combines the benefits
            of liquid and solo staking with added security through multiple
            validators (DVT). Additionally, staking native ETH provides access
            to exclusive solutions like Eigenlayer.

          <span class="text-r">
            Although there is a risk of smart contract vulnerabilities, Casimir
            minimizes this risk through open-source code, audits, and a bug
            bounty program. Validators/operators may face penalties, but thanks
            to Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), funds are not lost in
            case of their failure.

            Casimir is developed by Consensus Networks, a US-based team with
            extensive experience in the crypto space. The team has a history of
            early participation as node operators in various PoS protocols and
            has received grants from Web3 and government sources for digital
            asset management tool development.

          >
          <span class="text-r"
            >DVT enhances Ethereum's validation layer by distributing validator
            operations to multiple non-trusting nodes (Operators). These
            operator clusters run validators on behalf of stakers and address
            centralization, redundancy, and security challenges inherent in
            Ethereum's PoS consensus.

            >Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSDs) come with inherent risks,

            for stakers to provide their native staked ETH as liquidity
            providers (e.g., to support a DAO). Additionally, we will be
            introducing restaking mechanisms like Eigenlayer that will enable
            users to natively restake their ETH to maximize their APR, if
