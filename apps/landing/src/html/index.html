          </span>
          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir uses distributed validator technology (DVT) to pool users' ETH into 32
            ETH pools across 4 node operators. Users maintain custody through Distributed Key Generation
            (DKG), and rewards are distributed in native ETH based on their pool share.

          <span class="text-7">How are rewards generated?</span>
          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir's smart contracts combine your ETH into pools of 32 ETH (required by Ethereum's Proof of Stake protocol).
            It then stakes your ETH to a validator group comprised of 4 operators using Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).
            Rewards are then generated per the Ethereum Proof of Stake protocol and distributed to you in proportion to your share of the pool.

          <span class="text-r">
            Users can create an account by connecting their wallet to the Casimir app. This allows you to track your staking performance and
            manage your staked ETH. You don't need to register with an email or password. Simply connect a wallet and
            we'll automatically create an account for you. Connect other wallets/addresses and we'll associate them with your primary addresses.

            protocols?</span
          >
          <span class="text-r"
            >Casimir maximizes rewards while minimizing risks. It enables users to stake any amount of ETH to a pool of validators without 
            handing over custody to any single entity, which mitigates counterparty risk. It essentially combines the benefits of liquid and 
            solo staking with added security through multiple validators (DVT). Additionally, Casimir allows you to stake and earn rewards in 
            native ETH, which allows it to provide access to exclusive solutions like Eigenlayer, which then allow you to earn even more rewards 
            on your staked ETH.

        <div class="faq__item">
          <span class="text-7">What are the risks? </span>
          <span class="text-r">
            Although there are always risks when using smart contracts, Casimir
            minimizes this risk through open-source code, extensive audits, and a bug
            bounty program. Validators/operators may face penalties for bad or errant behavior, 
            but thanks to Casimir's DVT approach, stakers' funds are not lost in case of failure or slashing.

          <span class="text-7">Who is behind Casimir? Are the smart contracts open source and audited?</span>
          <span class="text-r">
            Casimir is developed by Consensus Networks, a US-based team with
            extensive experience in the crypto space. The company was involved in running node operators for 
            various Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols early on and has received grants from Web3 groups and government agencies
            for digital asset management tool development.

          >
          <span class="text-r"
            >DVT enhances Ethereum's validation layer by distributing validator
            operations to multiple non-trusting nodes (Operators). These
            operator clusters run validators on behalf of stakers and mitigate
            centralization, redundancy, and security risks inherent in
            Ethereum's PoS consensus protocol.

          >
          <span class="text-r"
            >LSDs come with inherent risks, notably counterparty risks. As LSDs essentially function 
            as IOUs, insolvency of the issuer could result in the permanent loss of a staker's ETH. 
            Casimir architecture avoids this.

          <span class="text-r">
            Although Casimir is not launching an LSD, there are opportunities
            for stakers to provide their native staked ETH as liquidity
            providers (e.g., to support a DAO). Additionally, we will be
            introducing restaking mechanisms like EigenLayer that will enable
            users to natively restake their ETH to maximize their APR, if desired.
